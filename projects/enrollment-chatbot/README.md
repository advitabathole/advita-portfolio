# UCSD Enrollment Chatbot

Built a chatbot that answers UCSD enrollment and academic calendar questions, like quarter start dates and add/drop deadlines. The bot uses a custom FAQ dataset and a simple Flask backend to provide quick, accurate responses. This project demonstrates building a web-connected AI tool with Python, HTML, and JavaScript, and can be expanded with smarter NLP features in the future.

## Features
- Answers common UCSD enrollment questions
- Uses a JSON dataset for fast lookups
- Web-based interface with a minimal chat UI

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- HTML / JavaScript
- JSON

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd projects/enrollment-chatbot`
3. Install Flask: `pip install flask`
4. Run the server: `python app.py`
5. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## Future Work
- Add GPT-based or embedding-based fallback for smarter answers
- Deploy online so others can try it
- Improve the frontend interface for a smoother chat experience
